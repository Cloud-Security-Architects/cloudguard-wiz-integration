# Automated Export of Access & NAT Policies to JSON for Wiz

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for enabling local logging of policies on Check Point Security Gateways. Please review Check Point documentation SK for general information: [sk183560 - Exporting Security Policy on a Security Gateway](https://support.checkpoint.com/results/sk/sk183560)
> **ℹ️ Note:**  This document was prepared with Wiz in mind; but it should work with other 3rd party  that require access to NAT and Access Rules.

## Overview

This installation deploys a small exporter on each gateway that periodically writes the Access Control and NAT rulebases to JSON files under `/var/log/rulebase_dump/`, ready for ingestion by Wiz and other external tools.

## Installation

### The Installer Command
Paste the following command as-is to fetch the current package from the gateway's `$CPDIR/ONLINE_SERVICES` cache, make the exporter script executable, and run its install action (which also schedules periodic exports):

```bash
UO_REVISION=$(grep -oP '(?<=<Last_Revision>)[0-9]+' "$CPDIR/database/downloads/ONLINE_SERVICES/1.0/last_revision.xml") ; chmod +x $CPDIR/database/downloads/ONLINE_SERVICES/1.0/$UO_REVISION/static_files/rulebase_dump/rulebase_dump.sh ; $CPDIR/database/downloads/ONLINE_SERVICES/1.0/$UO_REVISION/static_files/rulebase_dump/rulebase_dump.sh install
```

### Network Prerequisites
The installer reads the current package from `$CPDIR/.../ONLINE_SERVICES`. Make sure gateways have outbound connectivity (or a proxy) to fetch this content.
If the wrapper logs `Cannot find last_revision.xml`, fix connectivity and re-apply via the CME template (bump generation) or run the installer command again.
> **ℹ️ Note:** If you're using the wrapper, you can re-run it with `FORCE=1`.

## Expected Results
After installation, JSON files will be generated under `/var/log/rulebase_dump/`:
- `AccessRB_0.json` (or `AccessRB_<VSID>.json` on VSX)
- `NatRB_0.json` (or `NatRB_<VSID>.json` on VSX)

> **ℹ️ Note:** The first JSON may not appear immediately; it is generated by the exporter's scheduled run. Exports typically run twice daily (about every 12 hours).

# For Autoscaled Instances
### A. Via CME Gateway Template

The following steps ensure that every autoscaled instance (AWS ASG, Azure VMSS, OCI IG, etc.) runs the installer after policy installation, eliminating the need for manual steps.

### 1. Create A Wrapper Script
**Why a wrapper:**
The wrapper provides clear logging at `/var/log/rulebase_dump/setup.log`, idempotence via a stamp file, and keeps the one-liner intact for auditing. 
> **⚠️ Important:** The following 'Wrapper Script' should be saved as `install_rulebase_dump.sh`

**Where to save the Wrapper Script:** 
Save the wrapper anywhere on your admin workstation. For instance: `~/cme-scripts/install_rulebase_dump.sh`.
You can [copy the script from this repository](https://github.com/Cloud-Security-Architects/cloudguard-wiz-integration/blob/main/install_rulebase_dump.sh).

- **If you use the API:** upload it as Base64 into the Management Scripts Repository.
- **If you use the UI:** open Scripts Repository in SmartConsole and paste the script in cleartext (no Base64 needed).

> **ℹ️ Notes**
> 1. The script does not need to live on gateways; CME delivers it when the template runs after policy install.
> 2. The script is stored in the Management Scripts Repository (UI = cleartext, API = Base64). It does not persist on gateways; CME transmits it to be run after policy install.

### 2. Add the Wrapper to the Management Scripts Repository
- Generate Base64 (Linux): `base64 -w0 < install_rulebase_dump.sh`
- Generate Base64 (macOS): `base64 < install_rulebase_dump.sh | tr -d '\n'`
- Use the Management API `add-repository-script` or the SmartConsole UI to add it.

### 3. Add the Wrapper to the Management Scripts Repository
```bash
POST https://<MGMT>/web_api/v1.9/add-repository-script
X-chkp-sid: <SID>
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "name": "install_rulebase_dump.sh",
  "script": "<BASE64_OF_WRAPPER>"
}
```
### 3.1 Attach to Each CME Gateway Template

Add it under `repository_gateway_scripts` so it runs after policy installation on gateways built from that template. This process can be completed through both the CME API and the SmartConsole UI. 
```bash
{
  "repository_gateway_scripts": [
    { "name": "install_rulebase_dump.sh" }
  ]
}
```
To force existing instances to reapply after changes, bump the template generation and publish.

### 3.2 Attach to Each CME Gateway Template
You have two options to accomplish this task
1. [Using the SmartConsole UI](#using-the-smartconsole-ui)
2. [Using the API](#using-the-api)

> **⚠️ Important:** When done, don't forget to **Force reapply to existing gateways** (optional) and **Validate on a fresh instance**

## Option 1: Add Script to CME Template Using the UI
1.	In the SmartConsole UI, select 'Edit' the current CME configuration where you have your connected scaling deployment

![CHKP Wiz Integration](/resources/chkp-wiz-integration-A.png)

2. Select the template in which you want to enable the Wiz integration in the SmartConsole UI Start by looking at the templates available under the desired CME account and choose the Pencil icon on the CME template you wish to enable the integration.

## Option 2: Add Script to CME Template Using APIs

> **⚠️ Important:** Remember to publish your changes after updating the API.
In order to call the CME API you can:
- Utilize the Check Point provided Postman collection available at [CloudGuardIaaS/cme_api_postman](https://github.com/CheckPointSW/CloudGuardIaaS/tree/master/common/cme_api_postman).
- Directly call management APIs, in which case here are some examples on how to do so:

Attach to AWS Template
```bash
PUT https://<MGMT>/web_api/v1.8/cme-api/v1.3.1/gwConfigurations/aws/<TEMPLATE_NAME>
X-chkp-sid: <SID>
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "repository_gateway_scripts": [{ "name": "install_rulebase_dump.sh" }]
}
```
Attach to Azure Template
```bash
PUT https://<MGMT>/web_api/v1.8/cme-api/v1.3.1/gwConfigurations/azure/<TEMPLATE_NAME>
X-chkp-sid: <SID>
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "repository_gateway_scripts": [{ "name": "install_rulebase_dump.sh" }]
}
```
Attach to GCP Template 
```bash
PUT https://<MGMT>/web_api/v1.8/cme-api/v1.3.1/gwConfigurations/gcp/<TEMPLATE_NAME>
X-chkp-sid: <SID>
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "repository_gateway_scripts": [{ "name": "install_rulebase_dump.sh" }]
}
```
Attach to OCI Template
```bash
PUT https://<MGMT>/web_api/v1.8/cme-api/v1.3.1/gwConfigurations/oci/<TEMPLATE_NAME>
X-chkp-sid: <SID>
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "repository_gateway_scripts": [{ "name": "install_rulebase_dump.sh" }]
}
```


**On VSX, switch to the target Virtual System before inspecting files:**

```bash
vsenv <VSID>
ls -l /var/log/rulebase_dump/
```

Expect per-VS filenames like `AccessRB_<VSID>.json` and `NatRB_<VSID>.json`.

### When do the JSON files appear?

The installer sets up **scheduled** exports. The first JSON may **not** appear immediately. This is expected. Check `/var/log/rulebase_dump/setup.log` for “finished successfully,” then verify files after the first scheduled run window.

---

## For Tactical Use: Via SmartConsole ‘OneTime Script’

1. Ensure your admin profile has: **Gateways → Scripts → Run OneTime Scripts**.
2. Right click the gateway → **OneTime Script** → paste the installer command → **Run**.
3. Validate on the gateway as above.

> ℹ️ **Note:** For VSX, if you later shell into the appliance to verify, use `vsenv <VSID>` before checking files.

### Required permission (SmartConsole)

Ensure your admin profile has **Gateways → Scripts → Run One-Time Scripts** enabled. If you don’t see “One-Time Script” on right-click, ask your admin to add this permission to your role.

---

## OPS & Security Notes

* Treat `/var/log/rulebase_dump/` as **sensitive** (reveals reachability).
* Grant your collector only the **minimum** read privileges needed.
* **VSX:** verify per VS context with `vsenv <VSID>`.
* **Autoscale:** template inheritance ensures new/replaced instances auto-run the installer after policy install.

---

## Troubleshooting

* **No files yet?** First export may run on the next schedule window; check `setup.log` for successful install.
* **Reinstall intentionally:** run with `FORCE=1` (or bump template `generation`).
* **Autoscale host missed it:** ensure the template includes `repository_gateway_scripts` and that a **policy install** occurred; bump `generation` to force reapply.
* **VSX tip:** On VSX, switch to the target Virtual System before inspecting files:

  ```bash
  vsenv <VSID>
  ls -l /var/log/rulebase_dump/
  ```

  Expect per-VS filenames like `AccessRB_<VSID>.json` and `NatRB_<VSID>.json`.

# sk183560 Exporting Security Policy on a Security Gateway

- **Product**: Quantum Security Gateways
- **Version**: R81.20, R82
- **OS**: Gaia
- **Last Modified**: 2025-09-04

## Solution

### **Summary:**
This solution facilitates the automated export of Access and NAT rulebases from Check Point Security Gateways in JSON format, saving them to a designated directory on the gateway filesystem. These files can be read by external platforms—such as CNAPP tools like Wiz—to perform advanced security analysis, visualize toxic access combinations, and generate contextual recommendations.

The solution operates via the `rulebase_dump.sh` script, which schedules two daily exports at twelve-hour intervals. It is supported on Gaia based systems including VSX.

### **How to Enable:**
1. Open SmartConsole.
2. Right-click the applicable Gateway and select One-Time Script.
3. In the *Run One Time Script* window, paste this script on Security Management:
```
UO_REVISION=$(grep -oP '(?<=<Last_Revision>)[0-9]+' "$CPDIR/database/downloads/ONLINE_SERVICES/1.0/last_revision.xml") ; chmod +x $CPDIR/database/downloads/ONLINE_SERVICES/1.0/$UO_REVISION/static_files/rulebase_dump/rulebase_dump.sh ; $CPDIR/database/downloads/ONLINE_SERVICES/1.0/$UO_REVISION/static_files/rulebase_dump/rulebase_dump.sh install
```
4. Click Run.
5. Make sure the command succeeded.
6. Repeat steps 2-5 on relevant gateways.

### **Output:**
- The exported rulebase files are saved in this file on the Security Gateway: `/var/log/rulebase_dump/`
- Each time the script runs, the following policy files are exported in JSON format for integration or analysis:
    - `AccessRB_0.json` (or `AccessRB_<VSID>.json` in case of VSX)— Access rulebase
    - `NatRB_0.json` (or `NatRB_<VSID>.json` in case of VSX) — NAT rulebase

### **Important Notes:**
- Run the script once to install and schedule exports. Re-running it updates the export schedule. This enables consistent external policy syncing.
- The script supports Virtual System Extension (VSX) environments and exports rule bases for all configured Virtual Systems (VSs).
- The output files are in structured JSON format, suitable for ingestion by platforms such as Wiz to enable external policy analysis, graph modeling, or security insights.
